Had a pleasant time speaking at the [IUGG General Assembly 2023](https://www.iugg2023berlin.org/){:target="_blank"} about my research on MT studies in Northeast Japan! It was great to share ideas and connect with fellow academics and pros in the field. Super thankful for the chance to contribute and learn.
