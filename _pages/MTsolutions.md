# Magnetotelluric Data Solutions 

Welcome to my geophsyical consulting services with a focus on magnetotelluric (MT) data analysis. I offer professional asssistance to help you for understand and interpret your MT data effectively. My services include time series analysis, structural analysis, and modeling.

## 1. Time Series Processing

### Overview:
Time series processing involves analyzing, cleaning, and transforming time series data into frequency domain data with accuracy and reliability.

### Services Offered:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing noise, applying filters, and selecting high quality data segments to enhance signal coherency.
- **Fourier Transform**: Transforming the time series into frequency domain impedance and tipper.

### Benefits
- Clean data for enhanced interpretation of key geopysical features.

## 2. Structural Analysis

### Overview:
Structural analysis provides estimations on the dimension, oritentation, and complexity of the subsurface structure prior to modeling.

### Services Offered:
- **Dimensionality assessment**: Evaluating whether the overall subsurface structure is 1D, 2D, or 3D.
- **Structure Orientation**: Analyzing the subsurface orientation and anisotropy.

### Benefits:
- Clear understanding of the structure complexity and geological strike prior to modeling.
- Definitive reccommendation on the most suitable inversion scheme, whether 1D, 2D, or 3D.

## 3. Modeling

### Overview:
Modeling involves creating electrical resistivity models and validation of the models.

### Services Offered:
- **Forward Modeling**: Simulating MT responses for given resistivity models.
- **1D, 2D, 3D Inversion**: Creating resistivity models from the observed data.
- **Model Validation**: Comparing and assessing model model responses with observed data to examine sensitivity and resolution. 

### Benefits:
- Detailed and accurate subsurface models for exploration.
- Improved decision-making based on comprehensive geophysical insights.

As I begin my journey in the consulting field, I am eager to offer high-quality analysis at competitive rates. I welcome the opportunity to collaborate and support your projects.
