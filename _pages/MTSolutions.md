# Magnetotelluric Data Solutions 

Welcome to my geophsyical consulting services with a focus on magnetotelluric (MT) data analysis. I offer professional assistance to help you understand and interpret your MT data. My services include time series analysis, data analysis, and modeling.

## 1. Time Series Analysis

### Overview:
Time series analysis involves inspecting, cleaning, and transforming time series data into frequency domain data with accuracy and reliability.

### Services Offered:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing noise, applying filters, and selecting high quality data segments to enhance signal coherency.
- **Fourier Transform**: Transforming the time series into frequency domain impedance and tipper.

### Benefits
- Clean data for enhanced interpretation of key geopysical features.

## 2. Data Analysis

### Overview:
Data analysis includes extracting information on the dimensionality, orientation, and complexity of the subsurface structure prior to modeling.

### Services Offered:
- **Dimensionality assessment**: Evaluating whether the overall subsurface structure is 1D, 2D, or 3D.
- **Structure Orientation**: Analyzing the subsurface orientation and anisotropy.

### Benefits:
- Clear understanding of the overall trend and complexity of the structure.
- Definitive reccommendation on the most suitable inversion scheme for the data, whether 1D, 2D, or 3D.

## 3. Modeling

### Overview:
Modeling involves generating electrical resistivity models and validating the models.

### Services Offered:
- **Forward Modeling**: Simulating MT responses for given resistivity models.
- **1D, 2D, 3D Inversion**: Creating resistivity models from the observed data.
- **Model Validation**: Assessing model responses with observed data to evaluate sensitivity and resolution. 

### Benefits:
- Detailed and accurate subsurface models for exploration.
- Improved decision-making based on comprehensive geophysical insights.

As I begin my journey in the consulting field, I am eager to offer high-quality analysis at competitive rates. I welcome the opportunity to collaborate and support your projects. Feel free to [connect with me](https://dienodiba.com/contact) to discuss how we can work together.
