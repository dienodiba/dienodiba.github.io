# Hi, I'm Dieno

I’m a PhD student in Geophysics at the University of Tokyo, Japan. My research focuses on developing and using the [magnetotelluric (MT) method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotellurics){:target="_blank"} to explore fluids and melts that influence magmatic and seismic activity in the Northeast Japan subduction zone.

I’m also into programming and created [FITE2DMT](https://dienodiba.com/FITE2DMT), a Julia-based MT inversion code. It is designed for fast and accurate interpretation of MT data, especially when topography is a factor.

On the side, I’ve started helping out with MT projects, offering support in areas like time-series processing, dimensionality analysis, modeling, inversion, and interpretation.
